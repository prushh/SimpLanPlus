/*
Aliasing example, if a function which can have 2 or more pointers as formal parametes
    results in having them canceled, there is no problem until the corresponding
    actual parameter of that function's invocation are alias. If so, raise an aliasing error

OUTPUT:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
You had: 1 effect errors:
	Aliasing error in function call f on pointer: p
